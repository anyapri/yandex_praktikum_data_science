| [Research of real estate in Saint P](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/yandex_praktikum_data_science/blob/main/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%20.ipynb)       | Yandex.Realty if an archive of announcements on the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring localities. The task is to learn how to determine the market value of real estate objects. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.| 
| [Videogames](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/yandex_praktikum_data_science/blob/60406b6832ca51ec953fbe7efb912f6da0e58405/games.ipynb)   | Streamchik is an online store that sells computer games worldwide. Historical data on game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. The task is to identify the patterns that determine success of the games.      |   
| [Numerical methods](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/yandex_praktikum_data_science/blob/main/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8F.ipynb) | A service allows quickly find out the market value of your car. Having historical data (technical characteristics, equipment and prices of cars) the goal is to build a model to determine the value of a car.      | 
|[Supervised Learning](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/yandex_praktikum_data_science/blob/main/%D0%9E%D1%82%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2.ipynb)|Beta Bank is currently losing customers.

|[Machine Learning for Business](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/yandex_praktikum_data_science/blob/main/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F.ipynb) | Let's say you work for an upstream company called GlavRosGosNeft. You have to decide where to drill a new well. You are given oil samples from three regions. The characteristics of each well in the region are already known.|
|[User behaviour](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/yandex_praktikum_data_science/blob/main/%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%84%D1%8B.ipynb)| Mobile operator Megaline found out: many customers use archived tariffs. They want to build a system to analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra".|
